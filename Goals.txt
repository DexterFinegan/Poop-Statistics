2024 Poop Extractor Goals
Tasks completed denoted by X's on the right

Version 1 & 2 Goals
- Reimplement version 1's data collection, in separate functions
    - Allowing for return of users                                                                      X
    - Custom Names for users                                                                            X
    - A Save folder so no need to extract everytime                                                     X                                              
- Use multiple functions to clean the data with good explanations of each
    - Function to remove messages with no numbers in them, or are photos, voicemessages extract         X
    - Function to create a dictionary of a users input number form a message and date                   X
    - Function to chain together consecutive numbers, with their gaps                                   X
    - Function to analyse possible connections of chains                                                X
    - Function to connect chains with minimal missed numbers                                            X
    - Function to merge all users chained poops to one framework                                        X
- Extra functions
    - Function to recombine poops with original messages and reactions                                  X
    - Function to count number of gifs sent (for Jack)                                                  X       
    - Function to calculate most reacted to messages over a time period                                 X
- Data Representation
    - Pygame display of poops over time, akin to version 1                                              X
    - Plots of poops per month, pie charts etc                                                          X
    - Plot to compare funniness to poops                                                                X

    - Create Heatmap per user of time updated, and for the group each day of the week
    - Biggest Like Giver
    - Most Versatile Reactor
    - Biggest Content Sharer
    - Extrapolated data for lifetime poops 
    - Plot to compare poops per hour/per waking hour
    - Calculation to see how much money each person could earn if they pooped on work time 
    - Plot to compare the impact of weather/holidays on poops
    - Fucntion to extract weather data over days for comparison
    - Function to calculate longest and shortest time between poops per person and as a group 
    - Function to return all missed poops  
    - Refactor code to allow searching between certain datetimes, and so it all melds well with itself
    - Use Hypothesis testing to find whether Conor and Eoin are within normal bounds
    - Graph of consistency (dynamic?)  
    - Most supportive/supported person likes on messages containing updates exclusively
    - Rework algorithm for creating dataframe per user to optimize accuracy (especially gif related users)
    - Full shit length
    - Who get's aired the most
    - Biggest duo conversationalists 
    - Next poop prediction algorithm 
    - Most used emojis

    - If the body has to shit out the same amount of poop, how big is each persons poop 
    - supervised and unsupervised ML models on the data 
    - Did anyone like their own messages?
    - Graph of people that liked each person more and more to show best friends
